# QGIST Toolbar Generator

- [to be added]

We, the QGIST core developers, owe a big **Thank you!** to [`Customize ToolBars`](https://github.com/All4Gis/CustomToolBar) and its developer [Francisco Raga (@All4Gis)](https://github.com/All4Gis). `Customize ToolBars` is yet another plugin for creating customized toolbars for QGIS. It clearly showed that there has been a demand for this kind of functionality. As an independent project, `Customize ToolBars` existed long before `QGIST Toolbar Generator` was finally released for the first time. Having different priorities and following some fundamentally different technical approaches, we ultimately decided to develop a `QGIST Toolbar Generator` instead of improving `Customize ToolBars`. `Customize ToolBars` has several interesting features and is going to be a source of inspiration for `QGIST Toolbar Generator`.
